## Sprint 1 Retrospective
---
### What are practices that you should continue during next sprint
- good branch management (one branch per task)
- informative commit messages
- 2 reviewers per PR
- Pair programming
### What are some new practices that you might want to use during next sprint
- Start and finish work earlier
- Tasks for one story should usually be split between team members instead of handled by one member (increases communication)
- More testing should be incorprated (such as unit tests)
- Knowing when to use class vs functional components for react
### What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during next sprint
- Stop taking on stories that depend on each other in one sprint; causes some members to wait for another feature to be completed

- Worst: Last minute fixes
