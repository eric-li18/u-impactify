## Sprint 3 Retrospective
---
### What are practices that you should continue during next sprint
- Completing the desired features a couple days before the demo to ensure no last minute fixes and commits to master
- Testing thoroughly before and after merging to master to ensure app still works
- Having a test demo the day before the real demo to ensure the app still works
### What are some new practices that you might want to use during next sprint
- Being more clear on what needs to be implemented in stories
- Coding more efficiently so we do not come close to the firebase read/write limit since we're on the free plan
### What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during next sprint
- Not updating jira board when tasks/stories get completed
- Wasting time b/c of stories being dependent on other stories being completed
### What was your best/worst experience during sprint 2
- Best: Testing before demo to ensure peace of mind
- Worst: Firebase related bugs, and bugs in general
