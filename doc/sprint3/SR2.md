## Sprint 2 Retrospective
---
### What are practices that you should continue during next sprint
- Communicating between team members before merging conflicts
- Detailed PR descriptions
- Having 2 reviewers on PRs to catch mistakes
- Using vscode liveshare to help each other fix bugs/problems
### What are some new practices that you might want to use during next sprint
- Have a soft deadline before Wednesday night to ensure no last minute merges are made to master
- Testing more thoroughly before merging PR to make sure feature is integrated well into master
- Testing master before demo to ensure that it works
### What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during next sprint
- Not testing branch features before merging into master
- Adding last minute changes to master without testing
### What was your best/worst experience during sprint 2
- Best: vscode live share to help eachother
- Worst: Last minute changes to master
