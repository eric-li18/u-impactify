## How is your product different?
Our product is different because it’s intended use is for the not-for-profit sector whereas most other e-learning platforms are for-profit. U-impactify’s main goal is to help individuals who may not have the opportunity to go take courses at udemy or coursera due to financial constraints while on the other hand U-impactify can help these individuals through certain means such as the “giving garden” where students can apply for subsidized course offerings. Furthermore, the giving garden also allows students who have completed courses to volunteer their skills for consultants as well which gives them relevant experience, something no other e-learning platform does.
## If your product is better for specific users and/or specific scenarios?
Yes
## Who are the users and/or what are the scenarios?
The users and the scenario  would be people who do not have the means to go out and pay large sums for certifications and courses. These people could be new immigrants, students, as well as anybody else who may not have the financial means.
## Why do you think the competitors didn’t focus on these users and/or scenarios? And, what would it take from them to do so?
Competitors do not focus on these users/scenarios because they are not profitable. E-learning is mostly directed for people who are already in their career seeking further qualifications. A potential reason where competitors would decide to focus on these users/scenarios is if the demographic of e-learning users were to change from people seeking extra career qualifications to people without the means to do e-learning.
