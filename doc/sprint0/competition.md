## How is your product different?
Our product is different because it’s intended use is for the not-for-profit sector whereas most other e-learning platforms are for-profit. U-impactify’s main goals is to bridge the gap between individuals in the social sector or otherwise, instructors, and social initiatives. It does this by offering courses created by consultants in the social sector at a lower cost to students signed up on U-Impactify. It further helps students signed up on U-Impactify through the “giving garden” where they can offer their skills gained through taking courses. It also helps consultants and organizations by giving them a centralized platform to search for each other which can reduce time and money spent seeking each other. 
## If your product is better for specific users and/or specific scenarios?
Yes
## Who are the users and/or what are the scenarios?
A user and a scenario  would be people who do not have the means to go out and pay large sums for certifications and courses. These people could be new immigrants, students, people employed in the social sector, as well as anybody else who may not have the financial means. U-Impactify can provide these people with courses and opportunities at a lower cost.

Furthermore, initiatives who are seeking consultants/volunteers as well as consultants who are seeking to work for initatives or provide consultation can also use this platform as means of finding one another which can reduce time and money spent on marketing/searching.
## Why do you think the competitors didn’t focus on these users and/or scenarios? And, what would it take from them to do so?
Competitors do not focus on these users/scenarios because they are not profitable. E-learning is mostly directed for people who are already in their career seeking further qualifications. Also, the social sector isn't heavily funded so e-learning platforms have no reason to create courses for people who cannot pay for them.  A potential reason where competitors would decide to focus on these users/scenarios is if the demographic of e-learning users were to change from people seeking extra career qualifications to people without the means to do e-learning or who are underfunded.
