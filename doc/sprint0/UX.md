For our User Interface, we designed our mockup on Figma. Within our mockup are pages that lay out the various features of our application and the way they will be percieved by the 3 main users (student, instructor, and organizaition). The logical flow of the application begins at the left hand side of the mockup and flows towards the right, taking the user from landing page through all the pages that will be implemented in the application. At certain sections, the application page will vary in its design depending on the account type that accesses it, these variations are displayed in multiple pages listed directly underneath the original.
