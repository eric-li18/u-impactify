## Key Usage Scenarios
- Suppose Bob is a new immigrant with a Computer Science degree from an Institution which is not recognized in Canada even though he has an understanding of Computer Science. Bob is strapped for money and so he cannot afford to complete a certification from some company such as LinkedIn Learning/Coursera/Udacity. Bob can sign up for U-Impactify for a low monthly fee and take courses in software development. After he finishes the course he can go to the giving garden and offer his services to various organizations as a software developer. Now Bob has gained a certification at a low cost as well as valuable experience.
- Suppose Arthur is a consultant in the social sector. Arthur wants to be able to provide his services to various initiatives without having to scour the internet for postings since the social sector isn’t heavily advertised. Arthur can sign up for U-Impactify and use the giving garden to offer his services as well as create courses and receive passive income. Now Arthur can be in contact with various initiatives regarding consulting opportunities as well as earning income on his courses without the hassle of finding and contacting organizations by himself.
- Suppose Mary works for a social initiative called “X”. Suppose Mary is also working on a project for “X” with limited funding. With this limited funding, Mary is unable to train her employees and give them proper support since they are all acting as a jack of all trades. Mary signs up for U-Impactify for a low subscription cost and is now able to provide the proper training and support for her employees as well as hiring new volunteers from the giving garden. After using U-Impactify, Mary’s team is now better equipped to tackle the project for social initiative X.
