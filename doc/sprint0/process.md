# Sprint0 Process

Overall, our team worked very well during Sprint0 of this project. This was largely due to the fact that we stayed organized and worked efficiently. We had weekly meetings that lasted a duration of approximately 1.5 hours. These meetings took place online on a Discord audio/video channel.

 For this sprint, organization was very important because of the number of deliverables that needed to be completed. To organize the team itself, we decided to initially discuss all deliverables as a team, and then assign an individual, pair or group of three to work on professionally developing each of them. The assignment was done through a Messenger Poll where each team member was given an opportunity to choose something that they wanted to work on. If there was a conflict, the affected team members resolved the issue in their own time. The following is a specific list of how work was distributed:

| Task      | Team Member(s) | 
| ----------- | ----------- | 
| Product Backlog  | Discussed by team; created by Ivin, Shree, Roger, Harry, Simar |
| UX  | Discussed by team; created by Ivin, Shree |
| Process, Done Definition | Shree |
| Team Contract | Team effort |
| Summary, Competition| Simar |

Making decisions as a team were also done through Messenger Poll. We brainstormed ideas, as a group during a team call, and then a decision was arrived at by a majority vote. If an idea was not chosen by the group but there was a strong advocate for it, the team listened to their opinion and sometimes took a revote. This did not happen often, but it was a good solution for when it did. 

When making user stories, we decided to brainstorm all our ideas before attaching priority and story points to them. Once this was completed, we once again used a Messenger Poll in order to take the majority vote for priority. Because we talked about each story beforehand, priority was relatively easy to agree upon. The team knew that major stories that allowed us to demo the app were of high priority. The criteria we used to prioritize is listed below:

| Priority      | Reasoning | 
| ----------- | ----------- | 
| High | <ul><li>Stories that are unique features for the app, compared to similar apps</li><li>Stories that allow us to demo tangible progress, early on</li><li>Stories that require major backend or frontend design</li></ul>|
| Medium | <ul><li>Stories that support tangible progress to demo</li></ul> |
| Low | <ul><li>Stories that include ‘nice to have’ features that can be added near the end</li><li>Stories that do not require major backend or frontend design</li></ul> |


 Furthermore, we decided to use the Fibonacci Sequence for story points because most team members were familiar with it. To choose story points, we used an App called Scrum Time - Planning Poker. This allowed use to show the number of points we think is appropriate, and the majority was chosen.

Though our team worked well this sprint, something we could improve upon for next time is how often we have team meetings. For the duration of Sprint0, daily meetings as a team were not necessary, however this will change during later sprints. Ensuring that each team member is committed to daily standups will be a priority for this team.
