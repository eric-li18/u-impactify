Don't forget to run 

### `npm install` 

as we may be adding new dependencies as we go 

## Available Scripts 

In the functions directory, you can run: 

### `firebase deploy`

Deploys our functions to the cloud where the our api endpoint is available to copy and paste on the Firebase Web Console under Cloud Functions 

### `firebase serve`

Will use your device as a server and will generate a localhost endpoint. This is good for development and testing.
